# Employee-Salary-Management-with-Polymorphism
Employee salary system using inheritance and polymorphism. This project defines Employee as a base class, with FullTime and Contract subclasses handling fixed and hourly pay. Salaries are calculated dynamically, and a test program displays weekly earnings for different employees stored in an array.
